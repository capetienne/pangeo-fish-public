    "**Overview.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to use `pangeo-fish`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we will fit the geolocation on the data from the study conducted by M. Gonze et al. titled \"Combining acoustic telemetry with archival tagging to investigate the spatial dynamics of the understudied pollack *Pollachius pollachius*\", accepted for publication in the Journal of Fish Biology.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the biologging tag \"A19124\", which was attached to pollack fish.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the reference Earth Observation (EO) data, we consider the European Union Copernicus Marine Service Information (CMEMS) product \"NORTHWESTSHELF_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_PHY_004_013\".\n",
    "\n",
    "_NB: In addition to the Data Storage Tag (DST), the biologging data includes **teledetection by acoustic signals**, as well as the release and recapture/death information of the fish._\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the reference EO and the biologging data are publicly available, and the computations should be tractable for most standard laptops."

    "**Workflow.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first summarize the key steps for running the geolocation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the configuration:** define the required parameters for the analysis.\n",
    "2. **Compare the reference data with the DST information:** compare the data from the reference model with the biologging data. \n",
    "3. **Regrid the comparison to HEALPix:** translate the comparison into a HEALPix grid to avoid spatial distortion.\n",
    "4. **Construct the temporal emission matrix:** create a temporal emission probability distribution (_pdf_) from the transformed grid.\n",
    "5. **Construct another emission matrix with the acoustic detections:** calculate a similar model to the previous one, using this time the acoustic teledetections.\n",
    "6. **Combine and normalize the matrices:** merge and normalize the two _pdfs_.\n",
    "7. **Estimate (or _fit_) the geolocation model:** determine the parameters of the model based on the normalized emission matrix.\n",
    "8. **Compute the state probabilities and generate trajectories:** compute the fish's location probability distribution and generate subsequent trajectories.\n",
    "9. **Visualization:** visualize the evolution of the spatial probabilities over time and export the video.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this tutorial, you will gain practical experience in setting up and executing a typical workflow using `pangeo-fish` such that you can then apply the tool with your use-case study."
